	<p>This site is extremely basic, and for good reason.</p>
	<p>Some older mobile devices dont like rendering anything fancy so this is just a way of making sure everything works before anything is loaded.</p>
	<p>Please select your Devices Operating System, then proceed through the setup.</p>
	<p>Have a good day!</p>
