<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>Classic version! If you are running this version this means you are most likely running a non-retina screen. the way you can tell between having a retina or a non-retina screen is if you look at the battery icon on the status bar.</p>
<p>If you can see the indevidual pixles that make up that icon from a normal distance then you are running a non-retina screen. Otherwise click "Retina"</p>
